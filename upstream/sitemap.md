# Vercel Documentation Sitemap

## Purpose

This file is a high-level semantic index of the documentation.
It is intended for:

- LLM-assisted navigation (ChatGPT, Claude Code)
- Quick orientation for contributors
- Identifying relevant documentation areas during development

It is not intended to replace individual docs.

Canonical product names, aliases, and deprecations are published as JSON at [/docs/taxonomy.json](/docs/taxonomy.json).

A cross-link graph of the docs estate (per-page related pages, inbound links, and prerequisites, spanning vercel.com docs + KB, nextjs.org, ai-sdk.dev, and other Vercel doc sites) is published as JSON at /docs/graph.json, with per-page markdown maps at `<page>.graph.md` (for example /docs/functions.graph.md).
