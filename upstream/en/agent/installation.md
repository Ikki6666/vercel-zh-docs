## Getting started

> **💡 Note:** Vercel Agent Installation currently only supports projects with a GitHub repository connected.

To have Vercel Agent install **Web Analytics** or **Speed Insights** to your project:

1. Go to your [Vercel dashboard](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F%5Bproject%5D\&title=Open+Project) and select your GitHub-connected project.
2. Navigate to the **Analytics** or **Speed Insights** tab.
3. Web Analytics only: click **Enable** to turn on the feature.
4. Click the **Implement** button to start Vercel Agent.
5. Review the pull request and merge when ready.

Once the pull request is merged and deployed, tracking starts automatically. If you need to regenerate the pull request, click **Run Again**.

## Pricing

There is no charge for using Vercel Agent Installation. Standard usage charges for installed products, such as [Web Analytics](/docs/analytics/limits-and-pricing) or [Speed Insights Plus](/docs/speed-insights/limits-and-pricing), still apply.

## Package manager and private packages

Vercel Agent runs the repository's normal install command in a secure sandbox when a workflow needs dependencies. The repository determines the package manager and lockfile behavior. Vercel Agent does not promise to rewrite a lockfile or convert a project between npm, pnpm, yarn, and Bun.

To install private npm packages, [configure your team's shared registry credentials](/docs/agent/private-dependencies).
