- Speed Insights is free on Hobby, Pro, and Enterprise. Add the `@vercel/speed-insights` package to start collecting events.
- Speed Insights Plus is available for projects on Pro and Enterprise. It adds all Core Web Vitals, detailed breakdowns, and [Drains](/docs/drains).

Events from the free tier have no usage charges and do not count toward Plus usage. Speed Insights Plus has no included event allowance on Pro.

## Pricing

The free tier has no project fee or event charges on any plan.
On Pro, all events collected by Speed Insights Plus projects count toward paid usage.
On Pro, Plus also has a per-project monthly fee. Enterprise pricing follows your contract.

The following table outlines the price for events on each version of Speed Insights:

| Resource | Hobby Included | On-demand Rates |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Speed Insights Events | First 10,000 events | $0.65 per 10,000 events |


Pro teams can [set up Spend Management](/docs/spend-management#managing-your-spend-amount) to get notified or to automatically take action, such as [using a webhook](/docs/spend-management#configuring-a-webhook) or pausing your projects when your usage hits a set spend amount.

## Limitations

Projects that are only on Speed Insights share a free allocation of 10,000 events over the last 30 days.
This is a rolling window, not a calendar-month or billing-cycle reset.

When your team reaches the free tier limit, Vercel pauses collection for those projects for at least 14 days.
The pause continues while usage over the last 30 days remains above half of the free allocation.
Your sites keep running, and you do not incur event overage charges for the free tier.

Speed Insights Plus projects do not count toward the free tier limit. Reaching that limit does not pause collection for Plus projects.

If your team is on the Hobby plan, you have to upgrade to Pro to use Speed Insights Plus.

## Sample rate

By default, Speed Insights uses all incoming events to calculate the scores shown in the Speed Insights view.

To reduce the number of events collected, change the sample rate at the project level with the `@vercel/speed-insights` package, as documented in [Sample rate](/docs/speed-insights/package#samplerate).
For a comprehensive guide on reducing usage, including using `beforeSend` to filter specific pages, see [Managing Usage & Costs](/docs/speed-insights/managing-usage).

## Usage

The table below shows the metrics for the [**Observability**](/docs/manage-and-optimize-observability) section of the **Usage** dashboard where you can view your Speed Insights usage.

To view information on managing each resource, select the resource link in the **Metric** column. To jump straight to guidance on optimization, select the corresponding resource link in the **Optimize** column.

See the [manage and optimize Observability usage](/docs/manage-and-optimize-observability) section for more information on how to optimize your usage.
