# MCP Integrations

Connect your application or agent to a [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](/docs/mcp) server to use its tools. Choose an integration based on how you build your agent:

| Integration | Use it when | Connection setup |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [eve](/docs/mcp/integrations/eve) | You build durable backend agents with eve. | Define a connection under `agent/connections/` and configure authentication. |
| [AI SDK](/docs/mcp/integrations/ai-sdk) | You build agents and model calls with the AI SDK. | Create an MCP client and pass its tools to the model. |
| [TanStack AI](/docs/mcp/integrations/tanstack-ai) | You use TanStack AI's chat and streaming APIs. | Pass an MCP client to `chat()` for managed tool discovery and cleanup. |

The AI SDK and TanStack AI examples connect to a server hosted on Vercel and send model requests through [AI Gateway](/docs/ai-gateway). The eve guide connects to an OAuth-protected MCP server through [Vercel Connect](/docs/connect).

## Connect to a server

Each integration needs the MCP server's endpoint and any credentials that server requires. Model credentials and MCP credentials authenticate separate requests.

For OAuth-protected servers, see the Vercel Connect guides for [AI SDK](/docs/connect/frameworks/ai-sdk-and-mcp) and [eve](/docs/connect/frameworks/eve#authorize-an-mcp-connection).
