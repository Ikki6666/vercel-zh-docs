Requests are billed through AI Gateway and appear in your usage and observability alongside every other model you call.

If you are writing new code rather than migrating, use the [evaluation API](/docs/ai-gateway/modalities/evaluation) instead. It is the same capability without TypeSafe-specific naming.

## Base URL

The TypeSafe-compatible API is available at the following base URL:

```
https://ai-gateway.vercel.sh/typesafe
```

## Authentication

The TypeSafe-compatible API supports the same authentication methods as the main AI Gateway:

- **API key**: Use your AI Gateway API key with the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
- **OIDC token**: Use your Vercel OIDC token with the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header

You only need one of these. This is the credential AI Gateway authenticates you with, not the credential used to call the model.

To bill the provider directly instead of through AI Gateway, add a TypeSafe key under [BYOK](/docs/ai-gateway/authentication-and-byok/byok).

## Migrating an existing client

Change the base URL and the API key:

```diff filename="client.ts"
  import { TypeSafeClient } from '@typesafe-ai/sdk';

  const client = new TypeSafeClient({
-   apiKey: process.env.TYPESAFE_API_KEY,
+   apiKey: process.env.AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY,
+   baseURL: 'https://ai-gateway.vercel.sh/typesafe',
  });
```

Everything else stays the same:

```typescript filename="triage.ts"
const result = await client.systemOne({
  state: 'I was charged twice for my subscription.',
  questions: {
    refund: { type: 'noul', instructions: 'Is the customer asking for money back?' },
    department: {
      type: 'choice',
      instructions: 'Which team should handle this?',
      criteria: { billing: 'Charges and refunds', technical: 'Bugs and outages' },
    },
  },
});

console.log(result.answers.refund); // { type: 'noul', noul: 0.98 }
```

## Supported endpoints

- `POST /typesafe/v1/systemone` evaluates state against typed questions
- `GET /typesafe/v1/models` lists the evaluation models available to you

## Request and response format

This API implements the TypeSafe request and response shapes.

#### cURL

```bash filename="systemone.sh"
curl https://ai-gateway.vercel.sh/typesafe/v1/systemone \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "typesafe-ai/jev",
    "state": "I was charged twice for my subscription.",
    "questions": {
      "refund": {
        "type": "noul",
        "instructions": "Is the customer asking for money back?"
      }
    }
  }'
```

#### TypeScript

```typescript filename="systemone.ts"
import { TypeSafeClient } from '@typesafe-ai/sdk';

const client = new TypeSafeClient({
  apiKey: process.env.AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY,
  baseURL: 'https://ai-gateway.vercel.sh/typesafe',
});

const result = await client.systemOne({
  model: 'typesafe-ai/jev',
  state: 'I was charged twice for my subscription.',
  questions: {
    refund: {
      type: 'noul',
      instructions: 'Is the customer asking for money back?',
    },
  },
});
```

#### Python

```python filename="systemone.py"
import os
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "https://ai-gateway.vercel.sh/typesafe/v1/systemone",
    headers={
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {os.environ['AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY']}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    json={
        "model": "typesafe-ai/jev",
        "state": "I was charged twice for my subscription.",
        "questions": {
            "refund": {
                "type": "noul",
                "instructions": "Is the customer asking for money back?",
            }
        },
    },
)

print(response.json()["answers"])
```

The response uses TypeSafe's field names:

```json
{
  "model": "typesafe-ai/jev",
  "answers": {
    "refund": { "type": "noul", "noul": 0.98 }
  },
  "usage": { "input_tokens": 275, "output_tokens": 20 },
  "provider_metadata": {
    "gateway": {
      "routing": {
        "originalModelId": "typesafe-ai/jev",
        "resolvedProvider": "typesafe-ai",
        "canonicalSlug": "typesafe-ai/jev",
        "finalProvider": "typesafe-ai"
      },
      "cost": "0.00001155",
      "marketCost": "0.00001155",
      "surchargeCost": "0",
      "gatewayCost": "0.00001155",
      "generationId": "gen_..."
    }
  }
}
```

## Evaluation fallbacks

Evaluation fallbacks are an AI Gateway extension to the TypeSafe request. Add one conditional object to `providerOptions.gateway.models` to rerun a successful but uncertain evaluation with another model.

The official TypeSafe SDK forwards additional request properties at runtime, but its request type does not currently include `providerOptions`. Supply the extension through an intermediate object:

```typescript filename="typesafe-evaluation-fallback.ts" {21-30}
import { TypeSafeClient } from '@typesafe-ai/sdk';

const client = new TypeSafeClient({
  apiKey: process.env.AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY,
  baseURL: 'https://ai-gateway.vercel.sh/typesafe',
});

const request = {
  model: 'typesafe-ai/jev',
  state: 'I was charged twice and cannot sign in.',
  questions: {
    intent: {
      type: 'choice' as const,
      instructions: 'Which team should handle this?',
      criteria: {
        billing: 'Charges and refunds',
        account: 'Sign-in and account access',
      },
    },
  },
  providerOptions: {
    gateway: {
      models: [
        {
          model: 'openai/gpt-6-astra',
          when: { question: 'intent', confidenceBelow: 0.6 },
        },
      ],
    },
  },
};

const result = await client.systemOne(request);
```

> **💡 Note:** If a language model returns the final Choice or Score answer, `confidence: 0`
> and `probabilities: {}` mean those values are unavailable. They do not mean
> the model measured zero confidence. Native evaluation fallbacks preserve
> native confidence and probabilities.

Noul returns the fallback model's final `P(true)` normally. The response's top-level `model` echoes the model ID you requested when the primary answered, and names the fallback model whenever a fallback answered. AI Gateway routing metadata lists each model attempt and marks the one your condition triggered. Triggered requests bill both stages and report their combined usage.

When a condition matches, the response also carries these headers, listed in `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` so browser clients can read them:

| Header | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `x-ai-gateway-evaluation-fallback-triggered` | `true` |
| `x-ai-gateway-evaluation-fallback-final-model` | The model that produced the returned answers |
| `x-ai-gateway-evaluation-fallback-primary-model` | The primary model whose answers matched the condition |
| `x-ai-gateway-evaluation-fallback-triggering-questions` | A percent-encoded JSON array of the question IDs that matched. Read it with `JSON.parse(decodeURIComponent(value))` |

AI Gateway omits these headers when the condition doesn't match. Use them to detect a fallback when your client only reads TypeSafe's typed response fields.

See [Evaluation Fallbacks](/docs/ai-gateway/models-and-providers/evaluation-fallbacks#use-the-typesafe-compatible-api) for Boolean probability conditions, compound policies, the complete sentinel response, and two-stage cost and latency.

## Errors

Errors use TypeSafe's shape, with a machine-readable code alongside the message:

```json
{
  "message": "questions.refund.type: expected one of 'noul', 'choice', 'score'",
  "error_type": "invalid_request"
}
```

Errors returned by the model provider are passed through unchanged, so a client that already handles TypeSafe errors keeps working.
