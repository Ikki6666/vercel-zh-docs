# Evaluation

Evaluate a piece of shared state against typed questions and get structured answers back. Evaluation models return choices, scores, and boolean probabilities rather than free-form text, which makes them a fit for classification, routing, rubric-based assessment, and automated verification.

Several questions can be answered in parallel within a single request, against the same state.

To see which models AI Gateway supports for evaluation, use the **Evaluation** filter at the [AI Gateway Models page](/ai-gateway/models?capabilities=evaluation).

For a step-by-step setup, see the [Evaluation quickstart](/docs/ai-gateway/getting-started/evaluation).

> **💡 Note:** Through the AI SDK, evaluation requires AI SDK 7 or later. Evaluation is also
> available through the [HTTP API](#http-api) below and the
> [TypeSafe-compatible API](/docs/ai-gateway/sdks-and-apis/typesafe). It is not
> supported through the OpenAI-compatible, Anthropic-compatible, or
> Cohere-compatible endpoints.

## Basic usage

```typescript filename="app/api/evaluate/route.ts" {5-13}
import { experimental_evaluate as evaluate } from 'ai';

export async function GET() {
  const result = await evaluate({
    model: 'typesafe-ai/jev',
    state: 'The support agent issued a full refund to the customer.',
    questions: {
      refunded: {
        type: 'boolean',
        instructions: 'Was a refund issued?',
      },
    },
  });

  return Response.json(result.answers);
}
```

Each key in `questions` becomes a key in `answers`:

```typescript
// result.answers
{
  refunded: { type: 'boolean', probability: 0.99 }
}
```

## Question types

### Boolean

Returns a probability between 0 and 1. Supply `criteria` to define what the true and false cases mean.

```typescript
const result = await evaluate({
  model: 'typesafe-ai/jev',
  state: 'The build failed with exit code 1.',
  questions: {
    passed: {
      type: 'boolean',
      instructions: 'Did the build succeed?',
      criteria: {
        true: 'exit code 0',
        false: 'any non-zero exit code',
      },
    },
  },
});

// { passed: { type: 'boolean', probability: 0.01 } }
```

### Choice

Picks one option from a named set. `criteria` is a record of option names to descriptions, and the answer carries both the selected `choice` and the probability of each option.

```typescript
const result = await evaluate({
  model: 'typesafe-ai/jev',
  state: 'My card was charged twice for one order.',
  questions: {
    route: {
      type: 'choice',
      instructions: 'Route this support ticket.',
      criteria: {
        billing: 'payment or charge problems',
        shipping: 'delivery problems',
        technical: 'application bugs',
      },
    },
  },
});

// {
//   route: {
//     type: 'choice',
//     choice: 'billing',
//     probabilities: { billing: 1, shipping: 0, technical: 0 },
//   },
// }
```

### Score

Rates the state along an ordered scale. `criteria` is an array of at least two labels, ordered lowest to highest. The answer is an interpolated `score` plus the probability of each rung.

```typescript
const result = await evaluate({
  model: 'typesafe-ai/jev',
  state: 'The PR adds tests, updates docs, and has a clear description.',
  questions: {
    quality: {
      type: 'score',
      instructions: 'Rate the quality of this pull request.',
      criteria: [
        'poor: no tests or docs',
        'fair: partial coverage',
        'good: tests and docs',
        'excellent: tests, docs, and clear rationale',
      ],
    },
  },
});

// {
//   quality: {
//     type: 'score',
//     score: 2.97,
//     probabilities: { '0': 0, '1': 0, '2': 0.02, '3': 0.98 },
//   },
// }
```

## Multiple questions in one request

Questions of different types can share a single state, and are answered in one round trip.

```typescript filename="app/api/triage/route.ts" {7-24}
import { experimental_evaluate as evaluate } from 'ai';

export async function GET() {
  const result = await evaluate({
    model: 'typesafe-ai/jev',
    state: 'I cannot log in, and I also want a refund for last month.',
    questions: {
      authIssue: {
        type: 'boolean',
        instructions: 'Is there a login problem?',
      },
      wantsRefund: {
        type: 'boolean',
        instructions: 'Is a refund requested?',
      },
      urgency: {
        type: 'score',
        instructions: 'How urgent is this ticket?',
        criteria: ['low', 'medium', 'high'],
      },
    },
  });

  return Response.json(result.answers);
}
```

## Escalating uncertain evaluations

Evaluation fallbacks can rerun a successful evaluation with another model when a Choice or Score has low confidence, a Boolean probability falls inside an uncertain band, or a compound condition matches. Configure the policy under `providerOptions.gateway.models` for AI SDK `evaluate`, `POST /v1/evaluate`, or the TypeSafe-compatible API.

Evaluation fallbacks are opt-in and support one successful-response fallback stage. See [Evaluation Fallbacks](/docs/ai-gateway/models-and-providers/evaluation-fallbacks) for the condition contract, full-request rerun behavior, response metadata, and two-stage billing.

## Structured state

`state` accepts a string, an object, or an array, so you can pass structured records or a message history directly without serializing them yourself.

```typescript
const result = await evaluate({
  model: 'typesafe-ai/jev',
  state: {
    order: { id: 'A-1', total: 42.5, status: 'refunded' },
    agent: 'bot-7',
  },
  questions: {
    refunded: {
      type: 'boolean',
      instructions: 'Is the order refunded?',
    },
  },
});
```

## AI Gateway provider instance

When using an AI Gateway provider instance, specify evaluation models with `gateway.evaluationModel(...)`.

```typescript filename="app/api/evaluate/route.ts" {2,6}
import { experimental_evaluate as evaluate } from 'ai';
import { gateway } from '@ai-sdk/gateway';

export async function GET() {
  const result = await evaluate({
    model: gateway.evaluationModel('typesafe-ai/jev'),
    state: 'The support agent issued a full refund to the customer.',
    questions: {
      refunded: {
        type: 'boolean',
        instructions: 'Was a refund issued?',
      },
    },
  });

  return Response.json(result.answers);
}
```

## HTTP API

If you are not using the AI SDK, post to `/v1/evaluate` with the same `model`, `state`, and `questions` fields.

```bash filename="evaluate.sh"
curl https://ai-gateway.vercel.sh/v1/evaluate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "typesafe-ai/jev",
    "state": "I was charged twice for my subscription.",
    "questions": {
      "refund": {
        "type": "boolean",
        "instructions": "Is the customer asking for money back?"
      }
    }
  }'
```

The response reports the model that ran, the answers, token usage, and AI Gateway routing and cost metadata:

```json
{
  "model": "typesafe-ai/jev",
  "answers": { "refund": { "type": "boolean", "probability": 0.98 } },
  "usage": { "inputTokens": 275, "outputTokens": 20 },
  "providerMetadata": {
    "gateway": {
      "routing": {
        "originalModelId": "typesafe-ai/jev",
        "resolvedProvider": "typesafe-ai",
        "canonicalSlug": "typesafe-ai/jev",
        "finalProvider": "typesafe-ai"
      },
      "cost": "0.00001155",
      "marketCost": "0.00001155",
      "surchargeCost": "0",
      "gatewayCost": "0.00001155",
      "generationId": "gen_..."
    }
  }
}
```

Evaluation works with [BYOK](/docs/ai-gateway/authentication-and-byok/byok). If your team has added a key for the provider, it is used automatically.

### Provider options

`/v1/evaluate` accepts the same `providerOptions` as other AI Gateway endpoints, so you can require zero data retention or restrict which providers may serve the request:

```json
{
  "model": "typesafe-ai/jev",
  "state": "...",
  "questions": { "refund": { "type": "boolean", "instructions": "..." } },
  "providerOptions": {
    "gateway": { "zeroDataRetention": true, "only": ["typesafe-ai"] }
  }
}
```

String entries in `providerOptions.gateway.models` can name native evaluation models or language models, and a language model answers through structured output. The array also accepts one conditional evaluation fallback object. Provider-specific namespaces, such as `providerOptions.openai`, carry to a matching fallback provider. See [Evaluation Fallbacks](/docs/ai-gateway/models-and-providers/evaluation-fallbacks#configure-a-choice-or-score-confidence-fallback) for complete requests.

> **💡 Note:** Already using TypeSafe? The [TypeSafe
> API](/docs/ai-gateway/sdks-and-apis/typesafe) accepts TypeSafe's own request
> and response shapes, so an existing client only needs its base URL changed.

## Usage and pricing

Evaluation requests report token usage like any other model, and are billed from the model's per-token rates. Check the [AI Gateway Models page](/ai-gateway/models?capabilities=evaluation) for the rates on a specific model, since some evaluation models price input tokens only.

When an evaluation fallback triggers, both stages are billed and the response usage totals both calls. The stages run sequentially, so the request also includes both model calls' latency. See [two-stage usage and latency](/docs/ai-gateway/models-and-providers/evaluation-fallbacks#account-for-two-stage-usage-and-latency) for details.

```typescript
const result = await evaluate({
  model: 'typesafe-ai/jev',
  state: 'The support agent issued a full refund.',
  questions: {
    refunded: { type: 'boolean', instructions: 'Was a refund issued?' },
  },
});

console.log(result.usage);
// { inputTokens: 283, outputTokens: 21 }
```
