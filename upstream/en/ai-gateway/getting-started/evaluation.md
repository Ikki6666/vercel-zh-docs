## Run your first evaluation

### Use a coding agent

Paste this prompt into a coding agent with terminal access:

**Agent prompt**

```text
Add an evaluation request through AI Gateway in the current environment. Use the AI Gateway skill for this task. If it is unavailable, run npx skills add vercel/vercel-plugin --skill ai-gateway, then find and read its SKILL.md before continuing. Reuse the environment's Node.js project, framework, and package manager when possible. Otherwise, add the smallest TypeScript entry point and explain why. Use AI SDK 7 or later for this quickstart, and add only required dependencies. Read AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY from the environment. If it is missing, run npx vercel@latest whoami and pause for login if needed. Determine the team, then run npx vercel@latest --scope <team-slug> ai-gateway api-keys create --name <descriptive-name>. Capture stdout directly into AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY for the request or existing ignored secret storage, and never expose the value. Use typesafe-ai/jev to evaluate whether a support agent issued a refund, print the structured boolean answer, run the result, and report the output.
```

### Run the Node.js example

Use [Node.js 22.18 or later](https://nodejs.org/) and a team with available [AI Gateway Credits](/docs/ai-gateway/pricing). Export `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` in your current shell. If you need a key, open the [Create API Key dialog](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F%7E%2Fai-gateway%2Fapi-keys%3FshowCreateKeyModal%3Dtrue\&title=AI+Gateway+API+Keys).

```bash filename="Terminal"
export AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY="your_ai_gateway_api_key"
```

Install the latest AI SDK:

```bash filename="Terminal"
pnpm add ai@latest
```

Create `index.mts`:

```typescript filename="index.mts"
import { experimental_evaluate as evaluate } from 'ai';

const result = await evaluate({
  model: 'typesafe-ai/jev',
  state: 'The support agent issued a full refund to the customer.',
  questions: {
    refunded: {
      type: 'boolean',
      instructions: 'Was a refund issued?',
    },
  },
});

console.log(JSON.stringify(result.answers, null, 2));
```

Run the script:

```bash filename="Terminal"
node index.mts
```

This quickstart logs only `result.answers`. The probability can vary, but you should see output with this shape:

```json
{
  "refunded": {
    "type": "boolean",
    "probability": 0.99
  }
}
```
