# get_purchase_quote

Get a price quote for any purchase. This is a read-only action that never charges. It is the only source of an `idempotencyKey`, so it is the required first step before any `buy_*` tool usage. For products with no API price (add-ons, Pro), the quote includes a `priceNote` and a billing or pricing URL to review instead of a number.

You typically won't invoke this tool directly. Your AI client calls it automatically as the first step of any purchase and presents the quote for your approval.

## How purchases work

Every purchase uses the same quote-then-confirm flow:

1. **Quote**: Call [`get_purchase_quote`](/docs/agent-resources/vercel-mcp/tools/billing/get_purchase_quote) with the product and its parameters. This tool is read-only and nothing is charged. The response includes the cost (when Vercel can quote one), the applicable spend limit, and an `idempotencyKey` that encodes the quoted terms. Quoting is required before the `buy_*` tools can be used.
2. **Review**: Review the quote and approve it. Charges are immediate and non-refundable.
3. **Confirm**: Call the matching `buy_*` tool with `confirm: true`, the same parameters, and the `idempotencyKey` from the quote. Quotes expire after 5 minutes: an expired or mismatched key is rejected and you must quote again.

The flow provides these guarantees:

- Submitting the same `idempotencyKey` twice does not create a second charge.
- The `idempotencyKey` is a signed token of the quoted terms. The server rejects a confirmation call whose parameters don't exactly match the quote.
- Purchases require a valid payment method on the team. If no payment method is on file, nothing is charged and the response includes a `billingUrl` where you can add one before retrying.
- Your MCP client may prompt you before executing a `confirm: true` call. Declining the prompt never triggers a charge.
- A successful confirmation returns a `billingUrl` (team billing settings, where the charge appears) and a `proofUrl` showing the purchase. Billing history may take a few minutes to update.

**Sample prompt:** "Show me a quote for upgrading my team to Pro."
