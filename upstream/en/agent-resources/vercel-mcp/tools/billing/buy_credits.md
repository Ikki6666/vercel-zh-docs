Some credit types have plan prerequisites: Vercel Agent credits require the team to be on [Vercel Pro](/docs/plans/pro-plan) (upgrade first with `buy_pro`), and v0 credits require a paid v0 plan. AI Gateway credits have no prerequisite. If a required plan is missing, the purchase is rejected with guidance and nothing is charged.
