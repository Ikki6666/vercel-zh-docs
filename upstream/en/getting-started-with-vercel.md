# Getting started with Vercel

Install the Vercel CLI and deploy your app. If you use an AI coding agent, add agent support and connect Vercel MCP so it can work with your Vercel account.

**Agent prompt**

```text
Help me get set up with Vercel. Based on my project, do the following: 1. Install the Vercel CLI globally (`npm i -g vercel`) and log in with `vercel login`. 2. If you are Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Grok Build, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, or Kimi Code, install the Vercel Plugin with `npx plugins add vercel/vercel-plugin`. Otherwise, install Vercel Skills with `npx skills add vercel-labs/agent-skills`. 3. Connect the Vercel MCP server with `npx -y add-mcp https://mcp.vercel.com -g`. 4. Deploy with `vercel` and share the preview URL. 5. Suggest next steps based on my project, such as adding a custom domain, setting environment variables, or configuring Vercel Functions.
```

## Prerequisites

- A [Vercel account](/signup)
- [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/)

## Install the Vercel CLI

Every Vercel workflow starts with the CLI. Install it whether or not you use an AI coding agent. Agents that can run terminal commands use the CLI to deploy, pull environment variables, and manage projects.

- ### Install Vercel CLI
  <CodeBlock>
    <Code tab="pnpm">
      ```bash
      pnpm i -g vercel
      ```
    </Code>
    <Code tab="yarn">
      ```bash
      yarn global add vercel
      ```
    </Code>
    <Code tab="npm">
      ```bash
      npm i -g vercel
      ```
    </Code>
    <Code tab="bun">
      ```bash
      bun add -g vercel
      ```
    </Code>
  </CodeBlock>

- ### Log in to Vercel
  ```bash
  vercel login
  ```
  Follow the prompts to authenticate with your Vercel account.

- ### Deploy your project
  Navigate to your project directory and run:
  ```bash
  vercel
  ```
  The CLI detects your framework, builds your project, and deploys it. To deploy to production:
  ```bash
  vercel --prod
  ```

See the [CLI documentation](/docs/cli) for the full command reference.

## Install the Vercel Plugin

If you use [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), [OpenAI Codex](https://openai.com/codex), [Grok Build](https://x.ai/news/grok-build-cli), [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com), [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), or [Kimi Code](https://kimi.com), install the [Vercel Plugin](https://github.com/vercel/vercel-plugin). It gives your agent deployment skills, framework best practices, and slash commands like `/vercel-plugin:deploy prod` and `/vercel-plugin:env`.

```bash
npx plugins add vercel/vercel-plugin
```

The plugin activates automatically. No configuration needed.

See the [Vercel Plugin documentation](/docs/agent-resources/vercel-plugin) for the full list of skills, specialist agents, and slash commands.

## Install Vercel Skills for other agents

If your agent is not in the plugin list above, install Vercel Skills instead. Skills give your agent deployment and framework guidance in a format compatible with [Skills.sh](https://skills.sh).

```bash
npx skills add vercel-labs/agent-skills
```

To install a specific skill:

```bash
npx skills add vercel-labs/agent-skills --skill vercel-react-best-practices
```

See [Agent Skills](/docs/agent-resources/skills) for the full list.

## Connect the Vercel MCP server

Connect the Vercel MCP server so your agent can search the docs, manage projects and deployments, and query Web Analytics.

```bash
npx -y add-mcp https://mcp.vercel.com -g
```

See [Vercel MCP](/docs/agent-resources/vercel-mcp) for client-specific setup.

## Add a database or other storage

If your project needs a database, blob storage, or another backing service, you can provision one from the CLI and have Vercel wire the credentials into your project automatically.

Run [`vercel install`](/docs/cli/install) (alias for [`vercel integration add`](/docs/cli/integration#vercel-integration-add)) to install a Marketplace integration, provision a resource, connect it to the currently linked project, and sync environment variables into `.env.local`:

```bash
vercel install neon
vercel install upstash
vercel install supabase
```

Add `--help` to any command to see integration-specific products, metadata options, and billing plans. For non-interactive flows, pass options as flags:

```bash
vercel install neon --name my-database --plan free -e production -e preview
```

See [Storage on Vercel Marketplace](/docs/marketplace-storage) for the full list of storage integrations.

## Deploy from the dashboard

You can also deploy without the CLI. Go to the [New Project](/new) page, connect your [GitHub](/docs/git/vercel-for-github), [GitLab](/docs/git/vercel-for-gitlab), or [Bitbucket](/docs/git/vercel-for-bitbucket) account, select a repo, and click **Deploy**. Every push to your connected branch triggers a new deployment automatically.
