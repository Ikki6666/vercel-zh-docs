```bash filename="terminal"
sandbox run echo "Hello Sandbox!"
```

Use sandboxes to:

- **Execute untrusted code safely**: Run AI agent output, user uploads, or third-party scripts without exposing your production systems.
- **Build interactive tools**: Create code playgrounds, AI-powered UI builders, or developer sandboxes.
- **Test in isolation**: Preview how user-submitted or agent-generated code behaves in a self-contained environment with access to logs, file edits, and live previews.
- **Run development servers**: Spin up and test applications with live previews.

## Active CPU pricing for agents

Research shows that waiting for model inference accounts for [71% to 98% of runtime](https://arxiv.org/html/2605.26297v1#S5) across five agent benchmarks. With [Active CPU pricing](/docs/sandbox/pricing#active-cpu), Vercel doesn't charge you for CPU while your code waits for model responses or external APIs. You pay only for actively used CPU time.

The example below uses 10% CPU utilization.

### Example

For a sandbox with **1 vCPU and 2 GB of memory** running for **one hour at 10% CPU utilization**:

| Resource | Sandbox (Active CPU) | Wall-clock CPU billing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CPU | $0.0128 | $0.1280 |
| Provisioned memory | $0.0424 | $0.0424 |
| CPU + memory | $0.0552 | $0.1704 |


Both columns use the same `iad1` rates to compare billing methods. Wall-clock billing charges for CPU throughout the hour, including time spent waiting. Your CPU usage will vary.

You still pay for [allocated memory](/docs/sandbox/pricing#provisioned-memory) while the sandbox runs, including time spent waiting. The totals include CPU and memory only. See [pricing](/docs/sandbox/pricing) for other charges and included usage, and [stop your sandbox](/docs/sandbox/sdk-reference#sandbox.stop) when you finish using it.

## Using Vercel Sandbox

The Sandbox SDKs are the recommended way to integrate Vercel Sandbox into your applications. They provide a programmatic interface to create sandboxes, run commands, and manage files.

- **[JS SDK Reference](/docs/sandbox/sdk-reference)**: Use `@vercel/sandbox` for JavaScript and TypeScript
- **[Python SDK Reference](/docs/sandbox/python-sdk-reference)**: Use `vercel.sandbox` from the `vercel` Python package
- **[CLI](/docs/sandbox/cli-reference)**: Use the `sandbox` CLI for manual testing, agentic workflows, debugging, and one-off operations

For end-to-end examples using these interfaces, browse the [Vercel Sandbox
guides](/kb/vercel-sandbox).

## Authentication

Vercel Sandbox supports two authentication methods:

- **[Vercel OIDC tokens](/docs/sandbox/concepts/authentication#vercel-oidc-token-recommended)** (recommended): Vercel generates the OIDC token that it associates with your Vercel project. For local development, run `vercel link` and `vercel env pull` to get a development token. In production on Vercel, authentication is automatic.
- **[Access tokens](/docs/sandbox/concepts/authentication#access-tokens)**: Use access tokens when `VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN` is unavailable, such as in external CI/CD systems or non-Vercel environments.

To learn more on each method, see [Authentication](/docs/sandbox/concepts/authentication) for complete setup instructions.

## System specifications

Sandboxes run Linux images, with Ubuntu, Arch Linux, or any other Linux distribution you need. The default image is `vercel/sandbox/universal`, which includes the current Node.js LTS, Python 3.14, coding agents, and common utilities. You can use Vercel's [managed images](/docs/sandbox/concepts/images) or your own custom images stored in [Vercel Container Registry](/docs/container-registry).

For detailed information about the sandbox environment, see [Concepts](/docs/sandbox/concepts).

## Features

- **[Isolation](/docs/sandbox/concepts#isolation-architecture)**: Each sandbox runs in a secure Firecracker microVM with its own filesystem and network. Run untrusted code without affecting production.
- **[Managed and custom images](/docs/sandbox/concepts/images)**: Start sandboxes from Vercel's Managed Images, a shared or public image, or your own OCI images stored in [Vercel Container Registry](/docs/container-registry). Build your system packages and tooling into an image, and share it across projects and teams.
- **[System-privileged processes](/docs/sandbox/concepts#isolation-architecture)**: Run workloads that need system-level privileges, such as container runtimes like Docker, VPN clients, and FUSE filesystem drivers.
- **[Fast startup](/docs/sandbox/concepts#how-sandboxes-work)**: Sandboxes start in milliseconds, making them ideal for real-time user interactions and latency-sensitive workloads.
- **[Multi-agent isolation](/docs/sandbox/concepts/multi-agent)**: Give each AI agent its own Linux user with a private home directory, and share files between agents with groups.
- **[Persistent sandboxes](/docs/sandbox/concepts/persistent-sandboxes)**: Sandboxes that auto-save state on stop and resume where you left off. Persistence is the default. No manual snapshot management needed.
- **[Secure Compute](/docs/sandbox/concepts/secure-compute)**: Attach sandboxes to a Secure Compute network to send their public-internet traffic through static IPs, and reach your own VPC over VPC peering.
- **[Snapshotting](/docs/sandbox/concepts/snapshots)**: Save the state of a running sandbox to resume later. Skip dependency installation on subsequent runs.
- **[Tags](/docs/sandbox/concepts/tags)**: Categorize sandboxes by environment, team, or any other criteria using key-value tags.
- **[Drives (beta)](/docs/sandbox/concepts/drives)**: Attach persistent filesystem storage to sandboxes and reuse data across sandbox runs.
- **[Mount remote storage](/docs/sandbox/mount-remote-storage)**: Mount an external object store such as Amazon S3 with a FUSE driver, and read and write remote files through the sandbox filesystem.
- **[CLI and SDKs](/docs/sandbox/sdk-reference)**: Manage sandboxes through the CLI, JS SDK, or Python SDK. Automate sandbox workflows in your application.
- **[Ubuntu with Node.js, Python, coding agents and utilities](/docs/sandbox/concepts/images)**: By default, use Ubuntu with a large set of languages and tools available with full root access.
